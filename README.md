<h2>My Private Journal</h2>

<h3>Oct 23rd, 2020</h3>

My First React.js project was full of mistakes. I decided i had to startover because i didn't plan anything (as i had always do). Lesson learnt: don't code without planning, especially in building Apps.

Also i've been committing changes directly to master branch, probably if this was a real project i had to create new repo instead of deleting codes. But this is just a practice so i guess i'll keep on doing this here, as well as keeping journal to read maybe 10 years later to be nostalgic about. :v

I begin fresh and did the thing but the code looks messy. Spent around 8 hours just to make this is probably too slow, but with practice i'll gradually improve on speed and getting better understanding. 

What's left to do is designing the buttons, maybe I'll do it tomorrow after homework.

A noob question: can i place the 200 lines of quotes list elsewhere? ok time to sleep i'll find out tomorrow.

It looks kinda fancy now. Button and the "<a>attribute</a>" hasn't properly aligned and i still don't know how to align them. Next is to align them and add hover effects maybe.

A noob answer for my noob question: you can't place them somewhere else (i'm probably wrong).

Bye to this project.

Turns out you can place quotesList somewhere else and it's very easy.
