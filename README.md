<h2>My Private Journal</h2>

<h3>Oct 23rd, 2020</h3>

My First React.js project was full of mistakes. I decided i had to startover because i didn't plan anything (as i had always do). Lesson learnt: don't code without planning, especially in building Apps.

Also i've been committing changes directly to master branch, probably if this was a real project i had to create new repo instead of deleting codes. But this is just a practice so i guess i'll keep on doing this here, as well as keeping journal to read maybe 10 years later to be nostalgic about. :v
